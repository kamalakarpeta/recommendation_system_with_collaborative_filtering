# Building a Recommendation System with Collaborative Filtering

This Jupyter Notebook provides a basic Python script for building a recommendation system with collaborative filtering using the Surprise library. The script uses the MovieLens dataset, which is built-in in the Surprise library.

## Introduction
Collaborative filtering is a popular technique used in recommendation systems. In this example, we will use the Surprise library to build a recommendation system based on collaborative filtering. The script loads the MovieLens dataset, defines the algorithm object, performs cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance, and makes predictions on a test set.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required for this analysis:
- Surprise

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install scikit-surprise
## GitHub Repository
The code for this analysis can be found in the following GitHub repository: [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kamalakarpeta/recommendation_system_with_collaborative_filtering)

## Conclusion
In this example, we demonstrated how to build a recommendation system with collaborative filtering using the Surprise library. We imported the necessary libraries, loaded the MovieLens dataset, defined the algorithm object, performed cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance, and made predictions on a test set.

Please note that this is a basic example of a recommendation system and there are many
